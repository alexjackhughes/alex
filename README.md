# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little slice of the internet - It's my attempt at building a platform, rather than a portfolio to share my views on the world and give me a playground to improve my skills.

Tools? This was built with love using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Next](https://nextjs.org/).

Its hosted with [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Installation

To get started, just run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

And you're done! ðŸŽ‰
