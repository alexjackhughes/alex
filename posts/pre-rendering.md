# Hello

```tsx
    <Layout>
      <Head>
        <title>{postData.title}</title>
      </Head>
      <article className="prose lg:prose-xl">
        <h1>{postData.title}</h1>
        <div>
          <Date dateString={postData.date} />
        </div>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.contentHtml }} />
      </article>
    </Layout>
  );
```

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
